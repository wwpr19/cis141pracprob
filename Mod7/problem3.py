#3. In the game Pokemon, certain types of Pokemon do extra 
#damage to other types.
#For example, water is very effective to fight fire.
#Write a function called type_advantage(attacker, defender) 
#that takes two Pok√©mon types as
#strings and returns "Super Effective", "Not Very Effective", 
#or "Neutral" based on
#simple type effectiveness rules. Your solution only needs to 
#work for these three sets of input:
#print(type_advantage("Water", "Fire")) # "Super Effective"
#print(type_advantage("Fire", "Water")) # "Not Very Effective"
#print(type_advantage("Electric", "Grass")) # "Neutral"

def type_advantage(attacker, defender):
    
    if attacker == "Water" and defender == "Fire":
        return "Super Effective"
    elif attacker == "Fire" and defender == "Water":
        return "Not Very Effective"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

print(type_advantage("Water", "Fire")) # "Super Effective"
print(type_advantage("Fire", "Water")) # "Not Very Effective"
print(type_advantage("Electric", "Grass")) # "Neutral"
